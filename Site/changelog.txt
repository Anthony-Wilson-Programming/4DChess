Changelog for Anthony Wilson's 4 Dimensional Chess



=== TO DO ===
- Change the way gamestates are stored:
  > Change movement visuals to [B,T,X,Y] instead of [T,B,X,Y] (Reformat them altogether - [B0,T0,X0,Y0, B1,T1,X1,Y1, {Extra data}] - this allows for keeping track of moves and easily creating cross-time arrows)
  > Store pieces as simple integer arrays, instead of large object strings
  > Add arrows to indicate time-travel moves
  > Add timeline "ancestor"s. This should be a simple integer, which is a RELATIVE reference to the timeline that the target timeline was created from.
  > Add layout identifiers (useful for checking for castling)

- Seperate the game.js file into "API" and "Game control"

- Change the field class constructor - create a field straight from a simplified object

- Add timeline branch visuals (the elements will need to be contained by the field element because of z-index weirdness) (Will require gamestate change)
- Use SVGs for the piece sprites
- Change Import/Export game menu - looks horrible at the moment
- Add icons to the buttons
- Change the titlebar?

- Add a visual indicator for kings in check (detect automatically?)

- Make pawn promotion give a choice of pieces

- Create a page for making custom layouts / editing saves
- Add global and local game settings
- Add "How to Play" and "Credits"
- Add chess clock (options in global settings)

- Add move confirmation to online multiplayer
- Add per-game chat for online multiplayer
- Fix online multiplayer POV (specifically for Black)
- Add a "spectate"/"view only" mode for online multiplayer
- Use websockets for online multiplayer (hosted with NodeJS)

- Add a save-conversion page:
  > My JSON format to Alexbay218's notation
  > My JSON format to Alexbay218's JSON format
  > Alexbay218's notation to my JSON format



=== Roadmap ===
~ 1  - Fix current online multiplayer bugs
~ 2  - Implement branching timelines (that will round out all of the "5D" functionality)
~ 3  - Add "toJSON()" & "fromJSON" functions (for sending / storing the game)
~ 4  - Add "Undo" functionality and export/import game functionality
~ 5  - Add time-travel moves for the rest of the pieces
~ 6  - Rework online multiplayer (send games as JSON, store entire game on server, add server-side protection against attacks)
~ 7  - First release (1.0.2.1-1)
~ 8  - Add a way to detect check or checkmate.
 9  > Create option to use websockets. Add move confirmation to online multiplayer.
10 - Add global & local game settings
11 - Add computer player functionality
12 - Create clients written in multiple languages (Java, C#, C++)



=== Version History ===

[24/7/20] (0.0.0.1-0) - Project started

[?/?/20]  (1.0.0.?-0) - First working build, with most 5D moves. New boards are created when pieces are moved, and new timelines when pieces time travel.

[?/?/20]  (1.0.1.?-0) - Online multiplayer functional, with no menus and no way to create games.

[13/9/20] (1.0.2.1-1) - First release, including fully functional local multiplayer, online multiplayer, complete set of 5D Chess mechanics, importing/exporting game as JSON and much more. Roughly 3100 SLOC in total.

[13/9/20] (1.1.0.1-0) - Some minor tweaks to the code after the first release.

[13/9/20] (1.1.0.2-0) - Compacted the 4 2D loops that calculate most of the queen's time-travel moves into one 3 dimensional nested loop.

[14/9/20] (1.1.0.3-0) - Changed the colour and opacity of the past movement visuals.

[14/9/20] (1.1.0.4-0) - Tweaked some small parts of the code. Tested the delay between starting a web request and recieving an answer.

[16/9/20] (1.1.0.5-0) - Fixed a problem in some PHP files that caused the game password to be ignored.

[23/9/20] (1.1.0.6-0) - Began work on NodeJS websocket architecture to replace PHP requests. Added option to undo when playing online multiplayer.

[27/9/20] (1.1.0.7-0) - Changed the function that calculates a piece's moves - now storing them in an intermediate array before adding the elements using a seperate function. This makes far more sense for calculating piece danger.

[27/9/20] (1.1.0.8-0) - Added function to check for piece danger (implemented function to check if a king is in check).

[28/9/20] (1.1.0.9-0) - Changed the "unhide title bar" symbol to a classic hamburger menu symbol (3 horizontal lines).

[30/9/20] (1.1.0.10-0) - Changed the addMoveVisuals() function (made the code neater than it was, but it's still horrible). Added checkmate detection, which appears to work most of the time. It'll need a lot more tweaking to become 100% reliable though.

[30/9/20] (1.1.0.11-0) - Fixed "Undo" in online multiplayer. Tweaked checkmate detection, now more efficient and more reliable if both players are in check.

[2/10/20] (1.1.0.12-0) - Changed the way layouts are applied when creating a new game. Instead of generating them in code, pull the entire JSON file from the server, and load the game from that.

[3/10/20] (1.1.0.13-0) - Past-movement-visual arrays in simplified objects are no longer references, and are now stand-alone arrays.

[3/10/20] (1.1.0.14-0) - Layouts are now in a smaller JSON format, meaning less text to pull from the server. Added the 8x8 turn 0 starting layout. Changed castling move-detection to use normal if-clauses instead of switch/case, so that the same code can support multiple layouts.

[5/10/20] (1.1.0.15-0) - Changed the way board colors are set. Minor HTML edits.

[8/10/20] (1.1.0.16-0) - Added The Present functionality in the background. Added a page to render a game as a 1:1 scale image. You can no longer castle if in check. You can now deselect pieces.

[11/10/20] (1.1.0.17-0) - Changed the code which shifts all timelines down by one space. Now much more efficient, and less expensive.

[11/10/20] (1.1.0.18-0) - Minor HTML and CSS changes (Fixed scrollIntoView).

[11/10/20] (1.1.0.19-0) - "The Present" will now automatically update its position whenever a move is made. Added some padding field-tiles to make the field feel fuller.

[12/10/20] (1.1.0.20-0) - Fixed the knight time-travel moves. Added En Passant.

[12/10/20] (1.1.0.21-0) - Modified En Passant code. Compressed some nested if clauses.

[12/10/20] (1.1.0.22-0) - Changed castling detection code to a function. Added castling to the "Defended Pawn" layout.

[14/10/20] (1.1.0.23-0) - Removed "fullid" object attributes. Removed element IDs.

[17/10/20] (1.1.0.24-0) - Checkmate in now properly detected if the opponent can immediately move their attacking piece.

[17/10/20] (1.1.0.25-0) - Fixed a small bug causing "The Present" indicator element to have the wrong width.



[] (1.1.#.#-1) - Added a NodeJS websocket option for online multiplayer, which will be used by default, with the fallback being PHP requests.
