Changelog for Anthony Wilson's 4 Dimensional Chess



=== TO DO ===
- Add "The present"
- Add active and inactive timelines

- Change castling move-detection to use a function which takes in 4 params (king starting-pos, rook starting-pos, king post-pos, rook post-pos) and adds a visual if the move is valid.

- Confirm Knight time-travel moves (they may be incorrect)
- Add En Passant

- Add timeline branch visuals (the elements will need to be contained by the field element because of z-index weirdness)
- Use SVGs for the piece sprites

- Make pawn promotion give a choice of pieces

- Create a page for making custom layouts / editing saves
- Add global and local game settings
- Add "How to Play" and "Credits"
- Add chess clock (options in global settings)

- Add per-game chat for online multiplayer
- Add move confirmation to online multiplayer
- Fix online multiplayer POV (specifically for Black)
- Add a "spectate"/"view only" mode for online multiplayer
- Use websockets for online multiplayer (hosted with NodeJS)



=== Roadmap ===
~ 1  - Fix current online multiplayer bugs
~ 2  - Implement branching timelines (that will round out all of the "5D" functionality)
~ 3  - Add "toJSON()" & "fromJSON" functions (for sending / storing the game)
~ 4  - Add "Undo" functionality and export/import game functionality
~ 5  - Add time-travel moves for the rest of the pieces

~ 7  - First release (1.0.2.1-1)
~ 8  - Add a way to detect check or mate.
 9  > Create option to use websockets. Add move confirmation to online multiplayer.

=== Version History ===

[24/7/20] (0.0.1.1-0) - Project started

[13/9/20] (1.0.2.1-1) - First release, including fully functional local multiplayer, online multiplayer, complete set of 5D Chess mechanics, importing/exporting game as JSON and much more. Roughly 3100 SLOC in total.

[13/9/20] (1.1.0.1-0) - Some minor tweaks to the code after the first release.

[13/9/20] (1.1.0.2-0) - Compacted the 4 2D loops that calculate most of the queen's time-travel moves into one 3 dimensional nested loop.

[14/9/20] (1.1.0.3-0) - Changed the colour and opacity of the past movement visuals.

[14/9/20] (1.1.0.4-0) - Tweaked some small parts of the code. Tested the delay between starting a web request and recieving an answer.

[16/9/20] (1.1.0.5-0) - Fixed a problem in some PHP files that caused the game password to be ignored.

[23/9/20] (1.1.0.6-0) - Began work on NodeJS websocket architecture to replace PHP requests. Added option to undo when playing online multiplayer.

[27/9/20] (1.1.0.7-0) - Changed the function that calculates a piece's moves - now storing them in an intermediate array before adding the elements using a seperate function. This makes far more sense for calculating piece danger.

[27/9/20] (1.1.0.8-0) - Added function to check for piece danger (implemented function to check if a king is in check).

[28/9/20] (1.1.0.9-0) - Changed the "unhide title bar" symbol to a classic hamburger menu symbol (3 horizontal lines).

[30/9/20] (1.1.0.10-0) - Changed the addMoveVisuals() function (made the code neater than it was, but it's still horrible). Added checkmate detection, which appears to work most of the time. It'll need a lot more tweaking to become 100% reliable though.

[30/9/20] (1.1.0.11-0) - Fixed "Undo" in online multiplayer. Tweaked checkmate detection, now more efficient and more reliable if both players are in check.

[2/10/20] (1.1.0.12-0) - Changed the way layouts are applied when creating a new game. Instead of generating them in code, pull the entire JSON file from the server, and load the game from that.

[3/10/20] (1.1.0.13-0) - Past-movement-visual arrays in simplified objects are no longer references, and are now stand-alone arrays.

[3/10/20] (1.1.0.14-0) - Layouts are now in a smaller JSON format, meaning less text to pull from the server. Added the 8x8 turn 0 starting layout. Changed castling move-detection to use normal if clauses instead of switch/case, so that the same code can support multiple layouts.



[] (1.1.#.#-1) - Added a NodeJS websocket option for online multiplayer, which will be used by default, with the fallback being PHP requests.
