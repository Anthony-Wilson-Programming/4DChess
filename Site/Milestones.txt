Notable development changes made to the site:

[23/8/20]
Core movement mechincs now fully functional. When a piece makes a move on its local board the timeline will increase in length (duplication the selected board and making the move on the newset version of it). When a piece travels back or through time, the game will calculate if the timeline needs to split off. If the timeline does not need to split, it will be extended as usual, but if it does, a new timeline will be created (above or below the existing timelines depending on the player colour) and the piece will be moved to its new position.

[26/8/20]
JSON functionality fully implemented, along with "Import" and "Export" game options and an "Undo Move" button. This rounds out all of the (regular chess) local multiplayer functionality, meaning anyone can play a local game of normal chess against a human opponent.
